# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Decision-Tree
the code performs data loading, exploration, basic preprocessing (handling missing values), various visualizations to understand the data, and then builds, trains, and evaluates a Decision Tree Classifier for diabetes prediction. It demonstrates both a default model and one with slightly tuned hyperparameters.
